This project aims to discover a faster comparison method in BigInteger and BigDecimal. More information about the project could be found in the PDF file of Approximate Comparison. 
How to use:
1. Import the project in IDE;
2. There are two testcases in the project. Because this program need to compare the running speed between original comparison method in JDK and the extension comparison method written by myself. So I wrote two testcases, one is for the original BigInteger. The Class reference sequence is: AppTest！！>App！！>com.chinalife.samy.ucr.Comparable.math.BigInteger(this class in decompilated from the package of com.java.math). This is the slower one; Another is for the new BigInteger with the faster comparison method. And the class reference sequence is: AppExTest！！>AppEx！！>com.chinalife.samy.ucr.Comparable.mathEx.BigInteger, this one is faster;
3. Seperately run the two junit testcases, and you will find the results output the console, which indicates that the extended BigInteger performs better in the comparison method.
