To run this program, there are two things to be ensured:
1. ensure the game url (in Game.java file) could be connected successfully. In my case, the url is "http://gallows.hulu.com/play?code=jiupengs@andrew.cmu.edu". If not this url, please modify it in Game.java
2. ensure the dictionary file could be located correctly. In my project, I place it in the /dictionary/final/ path, make sure this path is correct. If you wanna run the program in the command line by inputting "java -jar Hangman.jar", please place the dictionary folder in the same folder with jar file.

More details about program could be spotted in AI.java, where I give a detailed comments. ^_^
